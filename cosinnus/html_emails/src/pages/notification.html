            Tom Tomson received your invitation and was initially extremely
            hesistant about the whole thing.  The thing is, Tom had already
            heard about Interested civilians and it gave rose to all sorts
            of envious internal gnashings, because it just sounded way too
            close to his budding 'awfully upright citizens 2.0' group. But
            late last night he came around after 2.5 minutes in the sensory
            depravation tank, and now he's on board.
